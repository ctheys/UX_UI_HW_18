            <h2><b>The Problem</b></h2>
            <p>Enthusiastic TV watchers with a daily desire for quality  viewing need an actionable way to select captivating shows and movies that are user-targeted while streaming on their subscribed platforms. Content options are broad, however it can take watchers a long time to make a decision  about what to watch, leading to wasted relaxation time.</p> 
            <h2><b>The Solution</b></h2>
            <p>The Solution: ‘Reelii’ is developing a mobile app to offer TV streamers  recommendations via friend’s sharing and by personal preferences.</p>
            <h2><b>The Process</b></h2>

            <h3>1 User Research</h3>
            <p>- User interviews and surveys
            <p>- Competitor analysis</p>

            
            <p>We began by discussing user viewing habits in 5 user interviews to understand  common frustrations with streaming services and how users decide on what  to watch. To compliment the user interviews we also conducted an online  survey that produced 35 responses. At the prototyping stage we were able to  do 8 user tests and iterate based on the feedback which resulted in the final  prototype. 
        The user interview plan was developed in order to obtain qualitative insights  on current consuming habits, pain points with available apps, and then to  further identify opportunities for ‘Reelii’ to solve the user problem. 
        A survey was then published on F√acebook and Instagram and reached a total  of 35 participants. Questions within the survey were targeted at yielding  quantitative data and further supported results gathered from the user  interviews.  
        Key findings were as follows:           
            <br>• 60% of the users use a streaming platform on a daily basis • 97% use Netflix. 
            <br>• The vast array of choice on these platforms made it difficult for the  users to pick a movie/tv show. 
        o On average, users would take 10 minutes to decide 
        o 74% have given up watching TV after not being able to decide. o To help them narrow down the options, users would either use the genre filter or ask a friend for a recommendation. 
        Through our research, we discovered that there are a few direct competitors  within the landscape that had developed apps with some similar features to  ‘Reelii’.</p>
